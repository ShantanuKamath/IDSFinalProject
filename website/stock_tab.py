st.markdown('#### How has the transport industry reponsed to Covid-19?')
st.markdown("""
  As soon as covid cases become prevalent in the United states, the stock price for the transport industry fell.
- Due to the sentiment that people will not want step out or restrictive quarantine laws.
- This lead to lesser rides and cutt a  majority share of revenue for these companies


Surprisingly, when the covid cases were at their peak:
- Stocks begin to rise mostly due to vaccines beings rolled out to the general public.
- This boosts the sentiment that people will be up and about again.

Waves:
- Both the waves seemed to cause the transport industry to remain almost plateau'd.
    - Before the first wave, the industry had already fallen, and there was no change until vaccine rollout.
    - Before the second wave, just as the industry was picking up again, the wave plateau'd the prices. 
    
Overall the transport industry hasn't yet fully recovered from the impact but is on track to be right where it was when it began, almost two years later.

st.markdown('#### The pandemic meant that people couldn\'t move out of their homes...This must have hurt the hospitality sector really bad :(')

st.markdown(""" For the hospitality industry we can see that once the first few cases of covid were reported in the US in early January 2020, the stock price of the hospitality industry fell because:

  *  There was a negative sentiment amongst the people because of all the uncertainty around covid.
  *  There were lockdowns enforced in different parts of the country because of which people were not travelling, and subsequently not staying in any hotels/Airbnbs.

Towards the end of the first wave in February 2021, we can see that the stock prices increase once again. This is because lockdowns and travel restrictions started getting lifted across the US. People started travelling more, and staying in hotels/Airbnbs.
An interesting trend that we note here is that the stock prices of Airbnb increased more that the stock prices of hotels like Marriott and Hilton. We hypothesise that this could be because of the following reasons: 

- Airbnb had just IPO'd hence their stock price was high because of the positive sentiments towards it.
- Also, this was at a time when most companies had switched to a remote work from home policy. As a result a lot of individuals started travelling to different places, and started working remotely while staying in airbnbs.

During the second wave the stock prices dipped again due to the fact that lockdowns and quarantine rules were enforced once again, leading to lesser travel and stay in hotels. Once again, once the second wave subsided, and lockdowns were lifted allowing to people to travel and stay in hotels, the stock prices increased.

st.markdown(""" * The stock prices drop from around the 20th February 2020, when news of Covid-19 began to spread, and the first cases of Covid-19 were reported. The stock prices plummet and hit their lowest values around 23rd March 2020.


* Due to the lockdown in the US, the consumer and corporate spending was largely very low. This is reflected in the stock prices recovering very slowly from the initial drop.


* We see that the stocks begin to rise as the lockdown eased in July 2020. People and businesses started spending more and there was an increase in the econonmic activity.


* When the first wave began around end of October 2020, stock prices for these companies fall suddenly. Businesses were forced to shut down or slow down, and consumers were forced to stay at home. Through the first wave, the stock prices remain relatively stagnant.


* As vaccination picks up starting February 2021, the stock prices continue to rise. Thus, vaccination instilled confidence in people, who began moving back to their pre-covid spending behavour.


* With the second wave starting around July 2021, the stock prices again began to drop for Visa and Mastercard, reflecting the spending slowdown by consumers and corporates.

Historical analysis of the events indicate that this was the time when around 10 states confirmed their first cases including New York.

* Yet another such dip is observed in March 2021. This could be due to the increasing speculation of lockdown across states.

* Some other interesting observations to note are that the e-commerce industry experienced a slight boom during the covid era, however the changes are not very significant. This is contrary to our intuition in which we expected a  positive investor outlook and subsequently a massive increase in e-commerce stocks as lockdowns and other restrictions would cause people to rely on e-commerce more.

With rise of covid cases in United States, Online Services stock value started rising significantly:

   * All three of them provide great stock market boosts. As people spent more time at home (less travel time, more idle time), they turned to online platforms for entertainment as well as social interaction.
   * Zoom especially became one of the go to video conferencing platforms adopted by educational institutes as well as corporates.
   * Twitter played its role in providing a platform to share covid news and voice out opinions.
   * Netflix provided a quick and fun way to take away boredom.

With the rollout of vaccines:

   * Twitter and Netflix were able to plateau or atleast rise a little.
   * Zoom started showing a downward trend probably due to companies and people going back to making things in person.

Yet, overall the online services have greatly increased their overall value compared to precovid times. There was a consistent rise in value through out the start and end of various waves of covid.

   * We also oberve that the stock prices started picking up pace around December 2020 -  January 2021, this can be accredited to the increase in vaccination (we see that the curve uphill begins around January 2021). Vaccination restored hope amongsts people that we might be able to fight off covid, hence deeply hit industries started to pick up again.
